In this lab we'll refactor code written using imperative style to functional style.

A series of tests that current pass are given along with code written using 
imperative style. Please take one function at a time and refactor it to 
functional style and makes sure the tests are still passing.

If you need a hint or two along the way, or get stuck in some steps, please do not hesitate to ask.
